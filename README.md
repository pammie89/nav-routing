# Navigation Bar - Coded with React Routing
Navigation Routing Assignment - Full Stack Web Development - M.I.T x/pro

This assignment was to improve upon the Navigational Routing assignment we did in this weeks Module.  These are the improvements that I made:

1.) I created pages for each navigational item 
2.) I added the navigation bar so it will display on each page 
3.) All pages html/css were coded with Bootstrap

# Future Improvements
1.) I would like to create a hover state on the nav items
2.) I would like to improve each of the actual pages by adding graphics and images to the pages.
